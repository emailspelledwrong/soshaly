# soshaly
A non-zuckerific social network that doesn't pelt you with ads, host jerks, or steal your data.

# Immigration & Naturalization
You can't get in unless you're invited to a Circle on soshaly by one of the existing members.

# Soshalizing
Once you're registered, you can create your own Circles and invite other users to join them (and soshaly).

You can post this kind of stuff:
- text
- reasonable pictures
- non-malicious web links

# Rules
1. Don't be a jerk, or "The Supreme Soshalist" will excommunicate you for as long as they see fit.
2. See Rule 1.

# Technical Stuff
This project is based on the FlaPyDoNG template.
